                I have experience working as a developer with several professional entities 
                including with Tyler Technologies on a conversion project, where I was responsible 
                for running conversions from old VB Script based pages, and updating them to more modern 
                Javscript based code. I had to step through and debug converted Javascript code, as well 
                as working with XSL style sheets and XML transforms. Through this project, I have exposure
                to working with MySQL queries for fetching data.

              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                I am also involved with Music Traveler, an international start-up that works on the Air BNB
                model to connect traveling musicians to musical-instrument equipped practice spaces while
                on the road. This project is mainly Python Django and Javascript based, with the backed running
                on a Redis data structure server, linked with PostgreSql. Currently based in Vienna, we are looking
                at establishing our footprint in the United States.

                I come from the world of transportation logistics with UPS, so I am very familiar with a

                in team environments.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    This is an online music player that takes songs from YouTube or SoundCloud and allows the user to create dynamic, custom
                    playlists. Tech stack includes React.js, including built in state management using useReducer and UseContext - although not a full-on replacement, 
                    this project shows that for many cases, it is very possible to have a good state management system without having to install the extra Redux package, 
                    using Provider, Consumer and React hooks. React also has a built in media player called ReactPlayer that was used for this project. Apollo Client was 
                    used to connect the front end to a database I set up on Neon, a serverless database host. This Project was built in order to explore and work with GraphQL 
                    a RestAPI alternative - the main advantage with GraphQL is the ability create custom queries, which only return the necessary data instead of a JSON object 
                    full of unnecessary data. Possible drawbacks to GraphQL, lie in the fact that the queries can quickly become complex, so for simple projects GraphQL may be 
                    overkill and not necessary.

                    This app is my foray into the amazing and mind blowing world of webRTC protocol - The Front-end (HTML/CSS) and folder structure 
                    of the project is rudimentary as I was mainly focusing on practicing with webRTC protocols including signaling - creating an offer and a response
                    between 2 host computers. Each client is setting up a local stream for itself (audio and video) and a remote stream for the incoming audio and video.
                    There is a peer connection that is generated after a mutual offer and response between 2 hosts, and an exchange of viable ICE candidates. With this project 
                    I am having trouble correctly initializing STUN servers, so currently the App only works when clients are connected on the same WiFi - otherwise,
                    I have tested that both users are able to join a mutually selected chatroom, but there is no exchange of audio or video.

                    This is designed to be a fully functional blog app with MongoDB database storing information such as registered users, created post content, post views - 
                    security features include password hashing for storage using bcrypt and JWT authentication with local storage for 7 day session storage. MongoDB virtual 
                    schema are included to validate if a user has made a post within the past 30 days, and will set the users account to inactive if activity has been longer
                    than 30 days ago. Other virtual properties include calculations for populating user posts and awarding user badges after reaching separate tiers. The final 
                    idea is to integrate Video Chat API so users can join a private chat room and video conference. This project utilizes the MVC design pattern.
